### **What is Simple Linear Regression?**

Simple Linear Regression is the OG of machine learning algorithms. It’s like drawing the best straight line through a bunch of points on a graph. The goal? Predict one thing (dependent variable, y) based on another thing (independent variable, x).

### **Equation of the Line:**

y=mx+c

Where:

- y = Predicted value
- x= Input feature
- m = Slope (how steep the line is)
- c= Intercept (where the line starts on the y-axis)

### **How It Works:**

1. The model looks at past data (pairs of x and y).
2. It finds the best possible values for m and c so that the line fits the data with minimal error.
3. Once trained, you can plug in new x values to predict y.

### **Error Measurement:**

The model minimizes something called **Mean Squared Error (MSE):**

$MSE=n1​∑(yactual​−ypredicted​)2$

Smaller MSE = better fit.

### **Use Cases:**

- Predicting house prices based on size
- Estimating sales based on advertising budget
- Forecasting temperature based on altitude
