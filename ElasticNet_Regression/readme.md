📘 Linear, Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net Regression

Regression models help predict continuous outcomes — like disease progression or sales numbers — based on input features. Let’s break it down:

Linear Regression: Fits a straight line to your data but can overfit.

Ridge Regression: Adds L2 regularization, shrinking coefficients to reduce overfitting.

Lasso Regression: Adds L1 regularization, which can shrink some coefficients to zero — a form of automatic feature selection.

Elastic Net: Combines L1 and L2 penalties, balancing shrinkage and sparsity


🛠️ Key Takeaways

Lasso is great for feature selection.

Elastic Net is flexible and handles correlated features well.

Grid Search helps find the best hyperparameters.

Cross-Validation gives a more robust performance estimate than a single train-test split.
