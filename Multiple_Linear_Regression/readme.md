Multiple Linear Regression: The OG of Predictive Modeling
Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is like simple linear regression’s big brother—it takes the same concept and cranks it up a notch by handling multiple independent variables instead of just one. It’s all about finding the relationship between a dependent variable (the thing you’re predicting) and multiple independent variables (the factors influencing it).

How It Works
Data Collection → Gather data with multiple predictor variables.
Feature Selection → Choose the most relevant independent variables.
Train the Model → Use algorithms (like Ordinary Least Squares) to find the best-fit line.
Evaluate Performance → Check R², Adjusted R², and p-values to see how well the model fits.
Make Predictions → Use the trained model on new data.


Key Assumptions (Don’t Ignore These!)
Linearity → The relationship between independent and dependent variables should be linear.
No Multicollinearity → Independent variables shouldn’t be highly correlated with each other.
Homoscedasticity → The variance of residuals should be constant.
Independence of Errors → Residuals (errors) shouldn’t be correlated.
Normality of Residuals → Errors should be normally distributed.



Use Cases
Finance → Predicting stock prices based on multiple factors.
Healthcare → Diagnosing diseases based on symptoms and test results.
Marketing → Predicting sales based on advertising spend, pricing, and seasonality.
Engineering → Quality control and defect prediction.
